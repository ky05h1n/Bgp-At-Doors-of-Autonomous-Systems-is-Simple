# Configuration for enja-host-3
# This is a simple host connected to enja-router-4

# ====================================
# INTERFACE CONFIGURATION
# ====================================
# Configure IP address on eth0 (connected to enja-router-4)
# Hosts should be in the same subnet to communicate via VXLAN
ip addr add 192.168.1.3/24 dev eth0

# Bring up interface
ip link set dev eth0 up

# ====================================
# NOTES
# ====================================
# - This host doesn't need routing configuration
# - All hosts (enja-host-1, 2, 3) should be in the same subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
# - VXLAN provides Layer 2 connectivity between all hosts
# - No default gateway needed for testing connectivity between hosts
# - The router will learn the MAC address automatically via BGP EVPN
